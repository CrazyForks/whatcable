/// Works out which Thunderbolt chain device each USB device sits inside.
///
/// The problem it solves: on a daisy chain (Mac -> display -> dock) macOS
/// publishes the USB devices as one flat forest per host controller with no
/// record of which downstream Thunderbolt device each one is physically plugged
/// into. The Thunderbolt fabric knows the chain exactly, and the USB tree knows
/// the hub cascade exactly, but nothing joins the two. Without a join, a dock's
/// Ethernet adapter renders five hub levels deep under the display the dock is
/// chained behind, which is where "12 rows, and you cannot tell what is plugged
/// into what" comes from.
///
/// No published technique exists for this on macOS, and `system_profiler
/// SPUSBDataType` returns nothing at all on the reference machine, so there is
/// no ground truth to copy. What follows is inference, and every step of it is
/// built to fail closed: **when the evidence does not single out one chain
/// device, the device stays unattributed and renders exactly where it does
/// today.** A wrong parent is worse than a flat list.
///
/// Three signals, in order of strength:
///
/// 1. **The name match.** A Thunderbolt device usually exposes its own USB
///    identity endpoint, and its `USB Product Name` is the same string the
///    fabric reports as `Device Model Name`. `TBT5 Docking Station 10-in-1`
///    appears in both. Two strengths of match, and the difference matters:
///    - **exact** (normalised equality): this device IS the chain device, so it
///      is absorbed into the chain row rather than rendered twice.
///    - **affiliate** (one name's words are a contiguous run inside the
///      other's): this device is PART OF the chain device. `TS5 USB 3 Hub` and
///      `CalDigit TS5 Audio - Rear` against a chain device modelled `TS5`;
///      `Apple Thunderbolt Display` against `Thunderbolt Display`. It marks its
///      hub but is never absorbed, because deleting a dock's audio endpoint
///      from the tree would be a bug, not a de-duplication.
///    Either way, the hub the device hangs off is that chain device's own
///    upstream hub, so everything under that hub is inside it.
/// 2. **Inheritance (structural).** Walking down the USB forest, a device takes
///    its nearest marked ancestor's owner. This is what separates a chained
///    dock's subtree from the display's while it sits nested inside it.
/// 3. **Vendor continuity (weakest, and heavily gated).** A device whose vendor
///    appears in exactly one chain device's marked region probably belongs to
///    that chain device. Applied top-down as a region mark, not per device, for
///    two reasons: it keeps a hub and its children together, and it makes the
///    collapsed and expanded views agree about where a device sits. An earlier
///    draft resolved it per endpoint in the collapsed view only, which put the
///    reference machine's Ethernet adapter under the dock by default and
///    somewhere else entirely once the user clicked "Show hubs".
///
/// Pure logic, no IOKit. `ConnectedDeviceTree` is the only caller.

        // parent hub is right in the common case: the hub genuinely is the
        // claiming device's own hub. Blocking needs POSITIVE evidence the hub
        // belongs to someone else.

        // collisions corpus-wide (22 exact matches, 51 VID-only matches
        // checked separately below). A number pair is a far stronger join
        // than a product-name string, which can coincide by accident or by a
        // generic word ("Hub"). Strings are still needed for two reasons:
        // some devices carry no exact numeric match at all (a hub chip's PID
        // is its own, not the dock's), and one corpus quirk means a VID
        // MISMATCH does not prove a different vendor (see `numericIdentity`
        // below), so numeric evidence is trusted only when it POSITIVELY
        // matches, never as a negative signal on its own.
        //
        // `numericIdentity(of:)` looks up the chain device (if any) whose DROM

        // own (idVendor, idProduct).
        //
        // Two defensive rules, both found by review (#493 round 5):
        //
        // 1. Zero is refused explicitly, even though `IOThunderboltSwitch`
        //    already normalises a non-positive/out-of-range DROM value to
        //    `nil` at parse time (see `IOThunderboltLink.swift`). Belt and
        //    suspenders: `USBDevice.vendorID`/`productID` default to 0 on a
        //    failed descriptor read (`USBWatcher.swift`), and a fixture or a
        //    future caller could still construct an `IOThunderboltSwitch`
        //    with `dromVendorID`/`dromModelID` of 0 directly, bypassing that
        //    normalisation. Without this guard, two unrelated devices that
        //    BOTH failed their descriptor read would "exactly match" each
        //    other on 0/0, and reproducing that promoted an unrelated hub.
        //
        // 2. The match set is checked for AMBIGUITY, not just existence,
        //    mirroring the file's existing duplicate-name rule ("two chain
        //    devices with the same model name match neither", `exact[...]`
        //    above). Two chain devices sharing an identical DROM VID+PID
        //    pair (two identical daisy-chained docks, the same product
        //    twice) both match, and picking "whichever comes first" silently
        //    cross-attributes one region into the other. More than one match
