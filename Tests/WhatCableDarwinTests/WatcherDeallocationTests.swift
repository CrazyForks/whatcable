/// `PowerTelemetryWatcher.start()` used to spawn its poll loop as
/// `Task { @MainActor in ... refresh() ... }`. A bare `refresh()` captures self
/// strongly, and self holds `pollTask`, so the two kept each other alive: the
/// object could only ever be freed if someone remembered to call `stop()`
/// first. Every sibling watcher captured weakly; this one did not.
///
/// It was dormant because all four call sites do call `stop()`, but
/// `PowerMonitorWindow`'s does so from SwiftUI's `.onDisappear`, which is a
/// convention rather than a guarantee. If it were ever skipped, the 1 Hz IOKit
/// and SMC reads would run against an unreachable object until the process
/// exited.
///
/// This is a real deallocation test, not a source-level one: it starts the
/// watcher, drops the only strong reference WITHOUT calling `stop()`, and
/// checks the weak reference clears. Reverting the `[weak self]` capture makes
/// it fail.
