/// Tests for the generation guard in `WidgetDataWriter.refreshPresence()`.

/// The startup seed check and the heartbeat's periodic check both call
/// `refreshPresence()`, and nothing enforces the order their results land
/// in. A slow startup lookup completing after a faster, later heartbeat
/// lookup already found a widget installed would, without the guard,
/// overwrite that correct "installed" with a stale "not installed" and
/// suppress writes for up to another heartbeat interval (~60s).
///
/// `GatedPresenceChecker` lets the test hold each call open and release
/// them in a chosen order, so the race is reproduced exactly rather than
/// relying on wall-clock timing. Both it and the test run on the main
/// actor, matching `WidgetDataWriter`'s own isolation, so task scheduling
/// order is deterministic: a task only yields the actor at its `await`
/// point, and the test controls when that is by choosing when to release.
