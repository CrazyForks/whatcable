// Discover what IS there, rather than confirm what we expected.
//
// Every other probe in this kit searches for class names somebody wrote down in
// advance. That design cannot find anything it was not already told to look for,
// and the corpus shows the cost.
//
// The SD-card transport node IOPortTransportStateSD appears in zero of 1135
// captures despite existing on every Mac with a card slot. 01_walk_pd_tree.c
// spent its entire life searching "AppleHPMInterfaceType", which is not a real
// class and matched nothing anywhere. And A-series Macs run a port-controller
// class, AppleHPMInterfaceType18, that no probe names: 17_deep_property_dump.c
// is genuinely blind to it, while probe 01 captures it only by accident,
// because it happens to descend from a class probe 01 does name. Data arriving
// under a name nobody recognises is barely better than not arriving.
//
// This probe matches NOTHING. It walks the whole IOService plane and asks the
// kernel to describe what it finds:
//
//   IOObjectCopyClass                     the class an instance ACTUALLY is
//   IOObjectCopySuperclassForClass        its parent class, BY NAME
//   IOObjectCopyBundleIdentifierForClass  the kext that publishes it
//
// The middle one is the point. Apple documents it as using "the OSMetaClass
// system in the kernel to derive the name of the superclass of the class", so
// the kernel will describe a class this program has never heard of. We do not
// need to predict what Apple ships next, only to ask. Walking it repeatedly
// yields the full ancestry, which is what lets an unknown class be filed under
// a family we already understand and matched by its base class thereafter.
//
// Output is class-level only: names, ancestry, kext, and per-class node counts.
// No properties, so this stays small (a few tens of KB) regardless of how much
// hardware is attached.
